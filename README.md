# Finalis UI Code Challenge

This challenge is intended for UI Web developer candidates at Finalis, the main idea is to evaluate your experience, workflow and skills when it comes to translate a mockup to an actual web component.

## Before you begin

Fork this repository and perform a `git clone` command in your local machine from the forked repository in your Github account.

### The Project

This project was created using `create-react-app` and utilizes `Styled Components` and `Chakra UI` as UI libraries, feel free to use whatever you prefer or feel confortable with.

The first time you clone this project run `yarn install` or `npm install` to install the dependencies, then run `yarn start` or `npm start` to build the project and run it in a development server.

### The Challenge

![Design Mockup](./public/mockup.png)

Given this design mockup [(Click here to open the Figma design)](https://www.figma.com/file/EYkb9JWPW7F4tpenorU1Fw/Front-end---UI-Challenge?node-id=10%3A735) you'll have to create that component with all its elements. Interactions for buttons are not necessary, but keep in mind we'll evaluate attention to detail and component composition. It's up to you to decide which part of this component's data comes through props and which part is static.

All data should come from some sort of backend API (For this challenge you can mock this data), consider using the strategy you see fit (Axios, redux, reactQuery, Apollo Client, etc). GraphQL would be a nice to have but is not mandatory.

The font family is already embedded in the project, and for the icons you can export them from the figma file as SVG or use this [icon library](https://iconscout.com/unicons/explore/line) 

### After you finish

Once you finish, make a pull request to your master branch so we can review all changes there. (Please don't push directly to master) as we'll also be evaluating your use of git.
